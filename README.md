# my-checkout-app-backend
## Description
My-checkout-app-backend powers the checkout system assessment project.
It receives cart list from the Frontend and returns a value in dollars/cent of the cart items.
While making provisions for discounted and non discounted sales.

#### The Flask framework was chosen to implement this project for the following reasons:
- Flask provides simplicity, flexibility and fine-grained control. It is unopinionated (it lets you decide how you want to implement things).
- It allows the use of as few dependencies as required which other more fleshed out frameworks lack.
- Flask accelerates development of simple web applications by providing the required functionalities.
- Timing: Development time with Flask is shorter when compared to it's Django counterpart when working on projects of this scale.

### Development Aproach
A sequential programming model was adopted as project requirements are well defined, established and stable.

### Programming paradigm
Choosing Procedural programming came in handy allowing for breaking down the programming task into a collection of variables, data structures, and subroutines.
